HIRA Model RESTful web service and User Interface Reference Implementations
===========================================================================

This is a RESTful service implemented in node.js and an user interface
implemented in HTML5/CSS3/Javascript/Angularjs.

The reference model is used to guide and evaluate the HIRA spec. The first
draft version of HIRA will be published in the Spring of 2014.

Most of the features implemented here are experimental and the system
is not intended to be used. However, it is available in this open
Github repository to provide transparency to and facilitate
communication with collaborators.
